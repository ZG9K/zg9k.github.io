# DisneylandToday
A faithful web recreation of the **Disneyland Today Broadcast Channel**, providing all you need to know on the Disney Parks right in your browser.
The site utilises the **[Theme Park API](https://api.themeparks.wiki/)** to fetch and display the **live status** of every attraction in Disneyland Resort. Put it on your TV*, in the parks, or at home, and have the magic feeling of the Disneyland Resort wherever you wish.

- Various settings to configure the functionality of the page (celcius/farenheit, Local time vs. Aneheim time)

### Potential Future Features:
- Custom music URL options
- Music volume slider
- Timed Events (E.g alarms, time based music, etc)

**Note: This site is designed to work in FHD 1080x1920p - a standard resolution for TVs found in hotels, as well as desktops, and other devices. Support for other resolutions will be looked into- however a mobile UI is unlikely. Despite this, I threw together a quick UI so the site is still somewhat accessible on mobile devices.*

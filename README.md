**Note: This site is designed to work in FHD 1080x1920p - a standard resolution for TVs found in hotels, as well as desktops, and other devices. Support for other resolutions will be looked into- however a mobile UI is unlikely. Despite this, I threw together a quick UI so the site is still somewhat accessible on mobile devices.*
